[![About](https://i.imgur.com/XgXthXs.png)]()

We wanted a simple plugin with maximum customisability in order to create pets with special abilities. Similar to many popular servers, we wanted these pets to be a new change that servers could implement.

So, we created **DestinyPets**. A simple yet powerful way to add customisability to your server!

DestinyPets comes with 15+ preconfigured pets, perfect for enhancing PVP and PVE. Create and customise your own pets in a dedicated configuration file, with pet levelling included!

[![Install Guide](https://i.imgur.com/GETKa3h.png)]()

At FallenDevelopment, we believe that the user shouldn't have to worry getting their plugin installed. We make this process as simple as possible across all our plugins.

This plugin does require an additional dependancy for certain features to work: **Vault**

Simply download your file from MC Market, place into your /plugins folder alongside the dependency, and restart your server!

All the customisable files will be automatically generated for you, ready to be configured and customised for your server.
